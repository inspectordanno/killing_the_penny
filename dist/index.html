    Millions of Americans still love the penny.
    <br> Why aren’t they aware of its cost and irrelevance?

  <article class="polling">
    <p>
      The penny is the ultimate symbol of misguided American nostalgia. It is a useless object, yet beloved by the majority of the public. 
      Despite not being accepted in vending machines and parking meters, and ignored by many cashiers, 
      Americans simply cannot get enough of their pennies. In a 2011 Huffington Post / YouGov poll,
      a clear plurality of subjects strongly opposed getting rid of the coin.

    <p>
      Pennies are so worthless that they can often be found sunbathing on the sidewalk.
      From a purely economic perspective, people would be better served by letting them remain on the ground.
      Yet a resounding majority of Americans choose to pick them up.

      To be fair, there is something about the penny that evokes fond memories for many people. 
      Maybe it’s the good luck associated with finding one heads up,
      or the distant recollection of going to the drugstore and ordering a root beer float with the change in your pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the penny has no place in modern society. Did you know it costs more than one cent to make a penny? 
      That the U.S. Treasury loses millions on them each year? 
      Price inflation has rendered pennies as valueless objects. If they were eliminated, 
      there is evidence to suggest that consumers and firms would be unaffected.
      And lastly, many other countries, such as Australia, Canada, and Switzerland, have gotten rid of them successfully.

      Still not convinced? Read on to experience the visual arguments for eliminating the penny.

  <div class="scroll_container" id="container_rounding">

      <div class='step section_title erase'>
        <h2>1. Getting rid of the penny won't harm consumers or businesses.</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph intro" data-step-rounding="1">
        <p>
          In a penniless world, the unit of a cent ($0.01) would not go away. Credit cards and digital payment systems
          would still be charged the exact price, down to the cent.
        </p>

        <p>
          But cash transactions would be a different story. Because pennies wouldn't exist, all transactions paid for
          in cash
          would be rounded to the nearest nickel. This means a sale could only end in a 0 or a 5.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some prices, the nearest nickel is cheaper than the price, and the price gets rounded down.
          This results in a gain to the customer, because they would be paying less than the sale originally.
          A customer can gain either <span class="one_cent_green">$0.01 (light green)</span> or <span class="two_cent_green">$0.02
            (dark green)</span> from rounding.
          In other instances, the nearest nickel is higher, and the price gets rounded up,
          resulting in a benefit to the store. A store can also gain either <span class="one_cent_red">$0.01 (light
            red)</span> or <span class="two_cent_red">$0.02 (dark red)</span>
          from rounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, there are prices that already end in a 0 or 5 and <span class="no_rounding">don't need to be rounded
            at all (light grey)</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="2">
        <p>
          These are a series of one hundred items, sampled in real life from data containing over three
          thousand products from a convenience store chain. 
          <span class="item_blue">Each rectangle represents the price of one item.</span>
          The data was supplied by Professor Raymond Lombra, a supporter of keeping the penny.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="3">
        <p>
          Lombra argues that because most items end in a 9, stores are most likely to benefit from a penniless world.
          In the graphic at right, a <span class="one_cent_red">store would gain $0.01 from each product that is light
            red</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="4">
        <p>
          A penny does not mean much on the individual level, but consider the collective implications of eliminating
          the penny.
          Merchants would gain millions, while customers would lose out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph conclusion" data-step-rounding="5">
        <p>
          The mean of all the rounding outcomes in the distribution is <span class="one_cent_red">$0.01 in favor of the
            store</span>.
          This means that in a penniless world, on average, one could expect most individual items to be rounded up
          $0.01.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="6">
        <p>
          However, there is an important caveat of rounding that serves a power counterpoint to Lombra’s model.
          It is evident that when people purchase goods as a store, they are not buying one item at a time.
          Rather, a transaction can consist of multiple items, and may also include tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          At right is a collection of one hundred real <span class="transaction_lavender">transactions</span> from another convenience store chain, sampled in
          real-time from a database.
          <span class="transaction_lavender">These transactions are composed of one or more items, and may or may not include tax.</span>
          In short, they are a more realistic representation of how people buy things at a store.
          This data was supplied by Professor Robert Whaples, a proponent of eliminating the penny.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="7">
        <p>
          Transactions have ending numbers that are much more varied than individual items.
          The colors are much more diverse than the previous item distribution, indicating a mixture
          of rounding outcomes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="8">
        <p>When the transactions are analyzed as a whole, it becomes even more clear that the bias towards stores has
          disappeared.
          There is a healthy proportion of transactions that benefit both stores and consumers,
          in addition to prices that do not get rounded.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph conclusion" data-step-rounding="9">
        <p>
          Furthermore, the mean of this distribution, rounded to the nearest nickel, is <span class="no_rounding">$0.00</span>.
          This indicates that an “average” transaction would undergo <span class="no_rounding">no rounding</span>.
          In practice, because the distribution is so diverse, there would be a wide variety of rounding outcomes.
          But as a whole, rounding would balance out. Therefore, eliminating the penny and rounding to the nearest
          nickel would have a nil effect. Because transactions are so varied, it would be very hard for businesses to price-fix, and it has not occured in countries that have already eliminated the penny.

      <div class='step paragraph intro' data-step-seigniorage='composition'>
        <p>
          Since 1982, the penny is made out of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper. 
          Before this, the penny was 95% copper and 5% zinc, but the composition was changed due to zinc being a much cheaper material.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-seigniorage='zinc'>
        <p>
          The price of zinc is quite variable, and it is not uncommon for the element to experience year-over-year changes in price in regards to supply and demand.
          What is concerning, however, is that starting in the 2000’s, the price of zinc has absolutely skyrocketed, far outpacing previous levels.
          The cost of zinc has been rising because it is a versatile metal with a variety of applications, especially in infrastructure.
          China has been a core driver of raw materials prices in recent years, especially as it continues to urbanize.
          In 2016, the Chinese spent $2 trillion on infrastructure, more than the U.S. and Europe combined!

      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-seigniorage='penny_cost'>
        <p>
          This graph presents the cost to mint a penny in the 2000's. Before 2006, a penny <span class="two_cent_green">cost less than one cent</span> to make.
          Since then, a penny has always <span class="two_cent_red">cost more than itself</span> to make, reaching a high of over two cents.

      <div class='step paragraph conclusion' data-step-seigniorage='seigniorage'>
        <p>
          In isolation, a cent might not seem like a big deal. However, the U.S. Mint produces 13 billion pennies each year.
          The Mint “sells” the coins to the U.S. Treasury, who pays the full production cost of the coins. 
          The difference between the face value of the coins and the cost to produce them is known as <i>seigniorage</i>. 
          Before 2006, seigniorage was a convenient way for the government to make money on pennies, as they <span class="two_cent_green">cost less to produce than they were worth</span>. 
          But since then, the government has been <span class="two_cent_red">losing millions on the penny each year</span>.

        <p>
          Price inflation has rendered the penny a worthless unit of currency. The graphic at
          right shows how the buying power of the penny has sharply decreased over the last
          100 years.

      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-buying-power='New York Times'>
        <p>
          Until the latter half of the 20th century, consumer goods were relatively cheap in terms of nominal cost.
          Americans made less money, but their money could buy a lot more.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-buying-power='postage stamp'>
        <p>
          In 1910, the penny had roughly the buying power of today’s quarter. The average wage was 22 cents per hour.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-buying-power='cup of coffee'>
        <p>
          Price inflation alone isn’t a good reason for eliminating small currency. For example, the nickel is another
          coin with paltry buying power. But getting rid of it would cause prices to be rounded to the nearest dime,
          which would hurt consumers a lot more.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph conclusion' data-step-buying-power='loaf of bread'>
        <p>
          Getting rid of the penny is ultimately about eliminating a denomination that is too small to be meaningful in
          today's economy.
