          Price inflation has rendered the penny a useless unit of cost.

          Until the latter half of the 20th century, consumer goods were relatively cheap in terms of nominal cost. Americans made less money, but their money could buy a lot more.

          In 1910, the penny had roughly the buying power of today’s quarter. The average wage was 22 cents per hour.

        <p>
          Price inflation alone isn’t a good reason for eliminating small currency. For example, the nickel is another coin with paltry buying power. But getting rid of it would cause prices to be rounded to the nearest dime, which would hurt consumers a lot more.

          Getting rid of the penny is ultimately about eliminating a denomination that is too small to be meaningful in today's economy.
