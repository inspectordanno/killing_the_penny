          Price inflation has rendered the penny a worthless unit of currency.

        <p>
          Until the latter half of the 20th century, consumer goods were relatively cheap in terms of nominal cost. Americans made less money, but their money could buy a lot more. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-buying-power='postage stamp'>
        <p>
          In 1910, the penny had roughly the buying power of today’s quarter. The average wage was 22 cents per hour.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='step paragraph' data-step-buying-power='cup of coffee'>
        <p>
          Price inflation alone isn’t a good reason for eliminating small currency. For example, the nickel is another coin with paltry buying power. But getting rid of it would cause prices to be rounded to the nearest dime, which would hurt consumers a lot more.

      <div class='step paragraph conclusion' data-step-buying-power='loaf of bread'>

          Getting rid of the penny is ultimately about eliminating a denomination that is too small to be meaningful in today's economy.

        <h2>Rounding Won't Hurt Consumers</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph intro" data-step-rounding="1">
        <p>
          In a penniless world, the unit of a cent ($0.01) would not go away. Credit cards and digital payment systems 
          would still be charged the exact price, down to the cent.
        </p>

        <p>
          But cash transactions would be a different story. Because pennies wouldn't exist, all transactions paid for in cash 
          would be rounded to the nearest nickel. This means a sale could only end in a 0 or a 5.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some prices, the nearest nickel is cheaper than the price, and the price gets rounded down.
          This results in a gain to the customer, because they would be paying less than the sale originally. 
          A customer can gain either <span class="one_cent_green">$0.01 (light green)</span> or <span class="two_cent_green">$0.02 (dark green)</span> from rounding.
          In other instances, the nearest nickel is higher, and the price gets rounded up, 
          resulting in a benefit to the store. A store can also gain either <span class="one_cent_red">$0.01 (light red)</span> or <span class="two_cent_red">$0.02 (dark red)</span> 
          from rounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, there are prices that already end in a 0 or 5 and <span class="no_rounding">don't need to be rounded at all (light grey)</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="2">

          These are a series of one hundred items, sampled in real life from data containing over three 
          thousand products from a convenience store chain. Each rectangle represents the price of one item.
          The data was supplied by Professor Raymond Lombra, a supporter of keeping the penny.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="3">
        <p>
          Lombra argues that because most items end in a 9, stores are most likely to benefit from a penniless world. 
          In the graphic at right, a <span class="one_cent_red">store would gain $0.01 from each product that is light red</span>.  
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="4">
        <p>
          A penny does not mean much on the individual level, but consider the collective implications of eliminating the penny. 
          Merchants would gain millions, while customers would lose out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph conclusion" data-step-rounding="5">
        <p>
          The mean of all the rounding outcomes in the distribution is <span class="one_cent_red">$0.01 in favor of the store</span>. 
          This means that in a penniless world, on average, one could expect most individual items to be rounded up $0.01.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="6">
        <p>
          However, there is an important caveat of rounding that serves a power counterpoint to Lombra’s model. 
          It is evident that when people purchase goods as a store, they are not buying one item at a time. 
          Rather, a transaction can consist of multiple items, and may also include tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a collection of one hundred real transactions from another convenience store chain, sampled in real-time from a database.
          These transactions are composed of one or more items, and may or may not include tax. 
          In short, they are a more realistic representation of how people buy things at a store. 
          This data was supplied by Professor Robert Whaples, a proponent of eliminating the penny.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="7">
        <p>
          Transactions have ending numbers that are much more varied than individual items.
          The colors are much more diverse than the previous item distribution, indicating a mixture
          of rounding outcomes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph" data-step-rounding="8">
        <p>When the transactions are analyzed as a whole, it becomes even more clear that the bias towards stores has disappeared. 
          There is a healthy proportion of transactions that benefit both stores and consumers, 
          in addition to prices that do not get rounded.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step paragraph conclusion" data-step-rounding="9">
        <p>
            Furthermore, the mean of this distribution, rounded to the nearest nickel, is <span class="no_rounding">$0.00</span>. 
            This indicates that an “average” transaction would undergo <span class="no_rounding">no rounding</span>.
            In practice, because the distribution is so diverse, there would be a wide variety of rounding outcomes. 
            But as a whole, rounding would balance out. Therefore, eliminating the penny and rounding to the nearest nickel would have a nil effect.
            This is a great argument for eliminating the penny.
